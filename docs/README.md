# Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation organized by category.

## Directory Structure

- **`bug-fixes/`** - Bug fixes, technical issues, and resolution documentation
- **`deployment/`** - Deployment guides, configurations, and deployment success logs
- **`integration/`** - Third-party integration documentation (Firebase, APIs, services)
- **`features/`** - Feature documentation, specifications, and implementation guides
- **`project/`** - Project-wide documentation (PRD, architecture, planning)

## File Naming Convention

All documentation files follow the date prefix format:

```
yyyy-mm-dd-{descriptive-task-name}.md
```

This ensures:
- Chronological organization
- Easy searching and filtering
- Clear context about when work was done
- Consistent naming across all documentation
